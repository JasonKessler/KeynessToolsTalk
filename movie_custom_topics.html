theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs.", "Just another disjointed, fairly predictable psychological thriller.", "Most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay, but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved", "It's just plain boring.", "Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call 'too clever by half.'", "Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger, more complicated story, one that never materializes.", "A
